ACTIVITY 6: What is wrong with this code?

Figure out what is wrong in the code below!
'''

name = "Bob" + 1

# Solution: the values must be the SAME TYPE.
# "Bob" is a string, while 1 is an integer
# It's like trying to add the number 7 to the word "tissue"

name = "Bob"
new_name = "Bob" + 1

# Here, name is a string, and 1 is an integer
# So again, we cannot mix and match different types
