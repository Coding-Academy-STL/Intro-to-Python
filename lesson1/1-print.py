Your first podcast will be awful
Your first video will be awful
Your first article will be awful
Your first art will be awful
Your first photo will be awful
Your first game will be awful
But your first code will be perfect.
Zero bugs and very clean code.
It will be "Hello, world!"
'''

# Your first program
# It prints Hello, world! in the console
# The console is the black box on the right
# Press "Run" at the top to see it in action!
print("Hello, world!")

# Print some more text
print("Python is fun!")
print("this is a string")
# A string is some text enclosed in quotes

# note that the 4 doesn't have quotes
# it is an integer
print(4)

# Prints 4
print(2 + 2)

# Prints the LITERAL TEXT 2 + 2
print("2 + 2")

# Notice that strings and integers are two different things!
# They are different TYPES

# Each print puts the result on a new line
print("2 + 2 = ")
print(2 + 2)

# Prints a blank line
print()
