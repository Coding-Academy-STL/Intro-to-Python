EXERCISE 1: Attack of the Pythons I (Printing)

An army of Pythons has attacked your city and you are trying to get into your secret apocalypse bunker. Fortunately, it has a password-protected lock so the Pythons can't get inside. Unfortunately, you forgot what the password is! Fortunately, you remember that it is equal to the value of the complicated mathematical expression 2+2-5*(9+7*2*(6+3*2)). Unfortunately, you can't do quick maths in your head. Print out your password using Python!
