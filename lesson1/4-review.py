REVIEW

Let's go over what we learned today
'''


# Variables have a NAME, a VALUE, and a TYPE

# You can't mix and match different types when doing addition
sum = 2 + 2 # OK
full_name = "Bill" + " " + "Wender" # OK
# bad = "2" + 2 # ERROR, "2" is a string while 2 is an integer


# Below will be a bunch of lines of code. This is for those who learn better visually.

my_age = 5
my_name = "Billiam"
my_new_age = my_age + 1
print("hi")

# print("my name is")
# print(my_name)
print("my name is: " + my_name)
