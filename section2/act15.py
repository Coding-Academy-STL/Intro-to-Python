ACTIVITY 15: I Love While Loops! (Conditionals, while loops)

Bobert really loves while loops because he doesn't need to predict how many times he needs to repeat, he just keeps on repeating until the condition is False. He wants to become a better pro spammer than Billiam, and he's going to use while loops to do so. He's going to print the same stuff as Billiam (he wants to print one line of "Hello world", one line of "I'm not a spammer", one line of "This is repetition number i", and one line of "spam detectors can't catch me lol") but repeat it infinitely! Mwahahahaha!
