ACTIVITY 10: I Love For Loops! (Conditionals, for loops)

Billiam is training to become a pro spammer. However, if he only prints "Hello world" a bunch of times, the spam detectors will find out and block him. So, he wants to print some more variety. So, he wants to print one line of "Hello world", one line of "I'm not a spammer", one line of "This is repetition number i" (where i is the variable that is looping), and one line of "spam detectors can't catch me lol" and repeat this 100 times. Please help him!
