ACTIVITY 14: Attack of the Pythons III (Conditionals, while loops)

An army of Pythons has taken over your city! You can't just hide in your bunker all day, so now you are going to fight the Pythons. Every second, you can kill 5 Pythons. However, every time you kill 5 Pythons, if there are any remaining Pythons, they will reproduce and the number of Pythons will increase by 3. Find out how many seconds it takes for you to defeat all of the Pythons if you start out with:
