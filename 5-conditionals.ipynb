    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditionals** are expressions in code that evaluate to **true** or **false** which are used to determine program flow. Conditionals are commonly used in **if statements** which contain a conditional and some instruction to do if that condition is met. For example, a condition could look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num < 5:\n",
    "    print('Yes')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we have a **condition** checking if the value of num is less than 5 and if it is, the **body** is the code inside the if structure which will print \"Yes\" if the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make if structures more specific, we can use **elif** and **else**. Elif stands for **else if** which in an if structure means that if the first condition wasn't met, then try this. Else means that if none of the previous conditions are met, then do the following. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "if num < 4:\n",
    "    print (\"Less\")\n",
    "elif num > 6:\n",
    "    print (\"More\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print (\"Middle\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This **if structure** will first check if num is less than 4. When it sees it isn't it skips the body code and looks to the next **elif** line which checks if num is more than 6. Since this is also false, it skips the body again and sees the **else** statement which means that since the previous conditions evaluated to false, it will print out \"Middle.\" You can add as many elif statements as you want to an if structure, you're not limited to just 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use conditionals in the form of **boolean** variables. These are variables that store true or false as data. Booleans are useful because they can hold the result of a conditional use it later on. Additionally, you can change the value of a boolean as needed which can be useful in many circumstances. Here is an example of booleans:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "smaller = 4 > 5 //False\n",
    "smaller = 6 > 5 //True\n",
    "\n",
    "if smaller:\n",
    "    //Body Code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have the boolean variable smaller start out holding False as a value, but then can be updated to True. Then it can be used as the condition of an if statement."
