    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditionals** are expressions in code that evaluate to **true** or **false** which are used to determine program flow. Conditionals are commonly used in **if statements** which contain a conditional and some instruction to do if that condition is met. For example, a condition could look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num < 5:\n",
    "    print('Yes')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we have a **condition** checking if the value of num is less than 5 and if it is, the **body** is the code inside the if structure which will print \"Yes\" if the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make if structures more specific, we can use `elif` and `else`. Elif stands for **else if** which in an if structure means that if the first condition wasn't met, then try this. **Else** means that if none of the previous conditions are met, then do the following. Here is an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "if num < 4:\n",
    "    print (\"Less\") #Skips this because num is more than 4\n",
    "elif num > 6:\n",
    "    print (\"More\") #Skips this because num is less than 6\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print (\"Middle\") #Prints this because none of the previous conditions are met\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember, you can add as many `elif` statements as you want to an if structure, you're not limited to just 1! But you can only have one `else` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make if structures more versatile, we can use `not` and `and`. `not` will check if a condition is **not** met and if it isn't met, then it will run the body code. `and` checks two conditionals and only runs the body code if **both** are met at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use conditionals in the form of **boolean** variables. These are variables that store true or false as data. Booleans are useful because they can hold the result of a conditional use it later on. Additionally, you can change the value of a boolean as needed which can be useful in many circumstances. Here is an example of booleans:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "smaller = 4 > 5 #False\n",
    "smaller = 6 > 5 #True\n",
    "\n",
    "if smaller:\n",
    "    #Body code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have the boolean variable smaller start out holding False as a value, but then can be updated to True. Then it can be used as the condition of an if statement."
