# Introduction to Python

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Ta180m/Python-Resources)](https://repl.it/github/Ta180m/Python-Resources)

Learn the basics of Python by making a fun tic-tac-toe game!


## For everyone:

 - Make sure you edit the `.replit` file to point to whichever file you want to run. For example, change `week1.py` to `week3.py` if you want to run the Week 3 code.

 - Click on the settings gear on the left, and make sure your indent type is set to "tabs" and your indent size is "4". This will prevent Python from complaining about your indentation!


## For students:

 - Make sure you have an Repl.it account!

 - Click "Introduction-to-Python" at the top, then click the button "Fork"
 
 - This will create your own copy of the project.
 
 - After you have your own copy, click "Share" in the top right and send the link to your group leader.

 - Watch the group leader's shared screen during the examples, and work on your own copy for the activities!


## For group leaders:

 - Do not edit week1.py, even to fix mistakes. It'll mess things up when you try to pull the latest version on your group Repl.
