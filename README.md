üêç A simple introduction to Python for everyone!


## Hi there!

Welcome! Ready to learn some programming superpowers? Well buckle your setbelts, because this is going to be quite the ride!


## What's computer science?

Here's the short answer: **Computer science** (CS) is the science of telling a computer how to do a certain task. Through this course, you're going to find out the long answer!

And even better, CS is an [incredibly vast subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#Fields), encompassing topics such as algorithms, machine learning, computer engineering, computer graphics, and much more!

![So much to explore!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4387/36231833334_3252f05552_b.jpg)


## What's a programming language!

Like human languages, there are many different **programming languages** we can use to communicate with computers. Computers can't understand us if we just talk to them (yeah, Siri and Alexa are a thing, but they're useless), so we use programming languages to instruct them what to do.

Some common ones:
- **Python**: A simple, elegant language capable of powerful wizardry!
- **JavaScript**: The language that powers the world wide web!
- **C++**: A low-level, efficient language for writing systems and servers.

## I wanna be a Python wizard! Tell me more about it!

Here are some fun facts about Python:
- Python was created by a Dutch programmer named Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Wow, Python's pretty dang old!
- Don't make this rookie mistake: It's named after TV show Monty Python, not the snake!
- Python was specifically designed to be **simple and readable**. I love things that my life easier!
- Python has **huge libraries** of code for many tasks. You build off of existing libraries to make cool stuff fast!
- It's one of the top three most popular languages.

## Alright, so what Python topics will we be learning?

We'll primarily be learning the basics, to give you a solid foundation for your future CS and Python explorations. Here's a short list of the topics covered:
- Input / output
- Variables
- Operators
- If / else
- Loops
- Functions
- Data types
- Using libraries


## Cool, but who even uses Python?

Glad you asked. Tons of everyday apps use Python. Ever used any of these?

## Wow! But what kind of stuff could *we* make?

Here's [2048](https://repl.it/@Ta180m/2048#main.py), similar to a project we're going to be doing in this course. Even better, you can take a glance at the Python code that powers that app.

Check out this [social media bot](https://social.exozy.me/@ebooks/), created using some powerful artificial intelligence libraries and [only 200 lines of code](https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/ebooks)!


## How do I use this course?

You can run the `.ipynb` notebook files with any [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) editor such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LadueCS/Intro-to-Python/HEAD) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). Binder is way easier, and the layout is pretty simple. You can select a file on the left. To run code, click inside the cell and press the run button at the top. Amazing, isn't it?


## What are some good resources for learning Python outside of this course?

Wow, what an overachiever! Just kidding, check out [this awesome list](https://github.com/LadueCS/Awesome-CS#python) for some truly awesome Python resouces. (And some other bonus programming goodies!)


## I'm teaching this course. What should I know?

I'm going to be blunt here: teaching beginners is really freaking hard. Seriously. But here are some tips as you embark on your teaching journey:
- Focus on **guiding and helping students through solving activities** instead of lecturing endlessly to them. You don't learn by listening to someone talking about Python. You learn by writing lots and lots of code. The students need plenty of chances to **write code and do activities**.
- **Go slow**. If you think you're going too fast and no one's understanding anything, you're going too fast.
- **Ask an insane amount of questions**. Like, make it feel like an interrogation. Questions are the ultimate tool for figuring out how well students are understanding. **Call on people randomly!** It's fun!
- When working on activities and projects, don't give students the solution unless they're really stuck. **Don't do the activites for them.** And if the students aren't understanding anything and can't solve the activities, you're going too fast.
- **Run the code for every example** and talk a bit about it.
- **Avoid using anything not mentioned in the course** since it confuses students. So don't use `print(1, 2)`, `input('Hello')`, `a,b = 1,2`, `'My name is {}'.format('Billiam')`, `for i in range(10)`, and so on.
- **Walk around and look at your students' code** to help them.


## Contributing guide

Interested in helping improve this course? Awesome. Lesson 3 through 12 all need to be expanded. Each lesson must contain 10 activities and should take the length of a one-hour meeting.

Make sure the title uses a `#` heading and activites use `##` headings. All output should be cleared. Write as many examples as possible and keep the pace slow. Remember to add a TL;DR section at the end of the lesson. Our goal is for the course to be optionally self-studyable if there isn't a teacher. Make sure the names of activites only have the first word and proper nouns capitalized. If you're not sure about a style detail, see [1-printing.ipynb](1-printing.ipynb) for a great example. We want a consistent style to look professional.
