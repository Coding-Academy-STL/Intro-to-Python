Learn Python by making a fun tic-tac-toe game!


## For students

 - You can run the `.ipynb` notebook files with any [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) editor such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LadueCS/Intro-to-Python/HEAD) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

 - If your group is using [exohub](https://hub.exozy.me/), create a new account. You can create a copy of the project by clicking the Git icon and cloning this link: https://github.com/LadueCS/Intro-to-Python

 - Watch the group leader's shared screen during the examples, and work on your own copy for the activities!


## For group leaders

 - Make sure you are giving students plenty of chances to **write code and do activities**.

 - **Go slow** and pay attention to how well the students are understanding by asking **lots of questions**.
