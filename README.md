Learn Python by making a fun tic-tac-toe game!


## For students

 - You can run the `.ipynb` notebook files with any [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) editor such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LadueCS/Intro-to-Python/HEAD).

 - If your group is using [CoCalc](https://calc.exozy.me/), create a new account. Your group leader will share a copy of the project with you.

 - Watch the group leader's shared screen during the examples, and work on your own copy for the activities!


## For group leaders

 - Make sure you have made your **own copy** of this project and are not editing the main CoCalc project.

 - Make sure you are giving students plenty of chances to **write code and do activities**.

 - **Go slow** and pay attention to how well the students are understanding by asking **lots of questions**.
