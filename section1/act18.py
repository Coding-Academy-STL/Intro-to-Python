ACTIVITY 18: Attack of the Pythons II (Printing, variables, input)

Since it seems like Pythons can do math a lot better than you, you have designed a new password system involving strings. However, you locked yourself outside the bunker, but you remember that your new password is the sum of the month and the day of your birthday, concatenated (mashed together) with your middle name. Ask the user for the month of their birthday, then the day of their birthday, and then their middle name. Print out what the password would be under the new system!
