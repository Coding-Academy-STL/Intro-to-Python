ACTIVITY 8: I Love Variables! (Printing, variables)

Billiam and Bob are trying to figure out who knows variables better. First, you need to create a variable called grade_of_Billiam and assign it a value of 6. Then, create a variable called grade_of_Bob and assign it a value two more than grade_of_Billiam. What are the types of the two variables you just created? Now print out the sum of their grades!
