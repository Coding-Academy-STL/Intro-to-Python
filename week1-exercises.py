EXERCISE 1: Attack of the Pythons I (Printing)

An army of Pythons has attacked your city and you are trying to get into your secret apocalypse bunker. Fortunately, it has a password-protected lock so the Pythons can't get inside. Unfortunately, you forgot what the password is! Fortunately, you remember that it is equal to the value of the complicated mathematical expression 2+2-5*(9+7*2*(6+3*2)). Unfortunately, you can't do quick maths in your head. Print out your password using Python!
'''



'''
EXERCISE 2: Variable Me (Variables)

Billiam wants to know how much you know about variables. Can you create 2 variables, my_name and my_age, and assign your name and age to those variables?
'''



'''
EXERCISE 3: Print Me (Printing, variables)

Sure, you can print your name and age using two print statements. But you know what's cooler? Printing your name and age using only one print statement.
Make sure you convert your age to a string using str( ), since it is an integer.
'''



'''
EXERCISE 4: String Addition (Printing, variables)

Someone sent you a message, but it got split into two variables. Add the two string variables together to make another variable that makes the complete message and print it out.
'''

first_part = "hello, my name "
second_part = "is Bill Nye"


'''
EXERCISE 5: Multiplication Overload! (Printing, variables)

Too much multiplication! Multiply the 5 integer variables together, then print the output!
'''

var1 = 42
var2 = 1729
var3 = -1
var4 = 998242353
var5 = 13


'''
EXERCISE 6: Fix the Code! (Printing, variables)

One of your group members wrote the following code, but it doesn't work for some reason. Can you find out why?

var1 = -61
var2 = "97"
var3 = 17
var4 = "-25"

print(var1 + var2 + var3 + var4)

Can you print the result as one long string? (answer should be "-619717-25")
Can you print the result from actually doing integer addition? (answer should be 28)
'''



'''
EXERCISE 7: Question Question (Printing, input)

This is a question about asking a question. Ask the user how old they are and get their input using input(). Then print a response: your own age.
'''



'''
EXERCISE 8: Triple Sum (Printing, variables, input)

Billiam can find the sum of two numbers, but he can't do the quick maths needed to find the sum of three numbers. Ask the user for three integers, then print their sum.
'''



'''
EXERCISE 9: Conversational (Printing, variables, input)

Have a nice conversation using input() and print()
Ex:
Ask for Name
Respond, then ask for favorite subject
Respond, ask for ...
etc.


print("What's your name?")
response1 = input()
print("Hi " + response1 + ", my name is Console")
print("What is your favorite subject?")
response2 = input()
etc.
'''



'''
EXERCISE 10: Attack of the Pythons II (Printing, variables, input)

Since it seems like Pythons can do math a lot better than you, you have designed a new password system involving strings. However, you locked yourself outside the bunker, but you remember that your new password is the sum of the month and the day of your birthday, concatenated (mashed together) with your middle name. Ask the user for the month of their birthday, then the day of their birthday, and then their middle name. Print out what the password would be under the new system!
