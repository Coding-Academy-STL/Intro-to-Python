REVIEW

We looked at another very useful data type today: lists.

Lists are extremely versatile and can even contain other lists as items.
Paired with for loops, they are even more powerful.

Note that in Python, the first item on the list has INDEX 0, the second has index 1, and so on. The last item has index len(your_list) - 1, or index -1 as shorthand.

We also looked at functions, which allow us to break up complicated tasks into smaller ones.

CHALLENGE 1: Todo

Simulate a todo list! Ask the user to input the action they want to do: append or remove. Then ask for what item to append or remove and print the list after every action!

CHALLENGE 2: 4-"function" calculator

Mimic a calculator, with operations as functions! Ask the user for a space separated math expression like "2 + 2" or "9 / 2". Then, use .split() to split the input string into three words, for example, ["2", "+", "2"] or ["9", "/", "2"]. Now write for functions for each operation and use the functions to evaluate the answer! Make sure you remember what the type of each variable is!
