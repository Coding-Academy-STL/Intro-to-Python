ACTIVITY 8: Factor

Ask the user to input a number, create a list containing all the factors of the number. Then find the sum of all the items in the list and print it out.

Hint: The % operator finds the remainder of a division. For example, 20 % 6 = 2 because 20 = 6 * 3 + 2, so 2 is the remainder.

Hint 2: What must the remainder be if another number is a factor of the input number?
