REVIEW

We looked at another very useful data type today: lists.

Lists are extremely versatile and can even contain other lists as items.
Paired with for loops, they are even more powerful.

Note that in Python, the first item on the list has INDEX 0, the second has index 1, and so on. The last item has index len(your_list) - 1, or index -1 as shorthand.

We also looked at functions, which allow us to break up complicated tasks into smaller ones.
