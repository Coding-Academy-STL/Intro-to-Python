USING LIBRARIES

Welcome to the first advanced lesson!
'''


# Python is a great language!
# But it doesn't have everything
# We can use LIBRARIES to extend what Python can do
# Libraries contain code that other people have written
# You can IMPORT them and build on top of other people's code!

# Let's look at a simple example
# Say we want to output colorful text
# First import a library
import termcolor

# Now we can use its functions!
termcolor.cprint('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red')

# The library termcolor contains the function cprint
# This function is similar to print but allows you to pass in two more arguments
# One controls the text color
# The other controls the background color

# Now let's work on Activites 1 and 2!


# Another example with random
import random


# itertools

# You can find all libraries at https://pypi.org/

# Add some more about looking up libraries and documentation
