CHALLENGE 2: Attack of the Pythons X

If you are reading this, you're probably a Python grandmaster by now. You've flown through all the basics, and the advanced stuff too! Umm need to think of a good challenge...

Here's a challenge.

A very hard one.

Get ready...

You've managed to break into the Pythons' Ultimate HQ. You navigate the twisting corridors of the HQ, and finally reach the throne room of Aiden, King of the Pythons: the evil lord responsible for the ongoing attack of the Pythons on your society. You prepare to face off with King Aiden in a duel.

King Aiden starts throwing pieces of Python code at you! You job is to write a program to read in each new line and run it as if it was a Python program. Good luck! A solution is definitely somewhere on the internet...
