CHALLENGE 2: 4-"function" calculator (Types, lists, functions)

Mimic a calculator, with operations as functions! Ask the user for a space separated math expression like "2 + 2" or "9 / 2". Then, use .split() to split the input string into three words, for example, ["2", "+", "2"] or ["9", "/", "2"]. Now write for functions for each operation and use the functions to evaluate the answer! Make sure you remember what the type of each variable is!
