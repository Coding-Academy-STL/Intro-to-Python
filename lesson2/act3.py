ACTIVITY 3: Password (Conditionals)

We can use len(insert_your_string_here) to get the length of a string.
name = "Billiam"
len(name) # 7

Ask the user to enter a password. If has a length less than 8 characters, tell them their password is insecure! Otherwise, tell them that they chose a good password.
