ACTIVITY 4: Booleans (Conditionals)

Bob wrote some code and he wants you to tell him what it does. Can you guess? Try changing the values of age and has_license and see what happens!

What are the types of the variables age and has_license?
'''


age = 18
has_license = False
if age >= 16 and has_license == True:
    print("You are old enough and have a driver's license.")
    print("You can drive!")
else:
    print("You can't drive yet!")
